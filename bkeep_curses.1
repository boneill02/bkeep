bkeep_curses \- dialog-based frontend for bkeep
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bkeep_curses
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I bkeep_curses
is a POSIX shell script for maintaining a book collection, which utilizes dialog
to allow for a more accessible interface. It does very little with the TSV file
that stores the collection, instead relying on the main \fIbkeep\fR command to
perform tasks.
